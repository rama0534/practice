        Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a sovereign country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, 
        the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.[13] It is the largest country in Oceania and the world's sixth-largest 
        country by total area. The population of 26 million[7] is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.
        [14] Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest city is Sydney. The country's other major metropolitan areas are 
        Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, and Adelaide. Indigenous Australians inhabited the continent for about 65,000 years[15] prior 
        to the first arrival of Dutch explorers in the early 17th century, who named it New Holland. In 1770, Australia's eastern half 
        was claimed by Great Britain and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 
        1788, a date which became Australia's national day. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades, and by the time of an 
        1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing crown 
        colonies established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia.</p>

         Australia has since maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary 
         constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories.Australia is the oldest,[16] flattest,[17] and driest
         inhabited continent, [18][19] with the least fertile soils.[20][21] It has a landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometres 
         (2,941,300 sq mi).[22] A megadiverse country, its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with deserts in the centre, 
         tropical rainforests in the north-east, and mountain ranges in the south-east. Australia generates its income from various 
         sources, including mining-related exports, telecommunications, banking, manufacturing, and international education.</p>

         Australia is a developed country, with the world's thirteenth-largest economy and tenth-highest per capita income.[26] 
         It is considered a regional power and has the world's thirteenth-highest military expenditure.[27] Immigrants account for
         30% of the population,[28] the highest proportion in any country with a population over 10 million.[29] The country ranks 
         highly in measures of health, education, economic freedom, and civil liberties.[30] Australia is a member of the United
         Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
         World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Pacific Islands Forum, and the ASEAN Plus Six.
