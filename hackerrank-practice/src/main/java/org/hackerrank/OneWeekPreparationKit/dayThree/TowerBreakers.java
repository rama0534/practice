//ðŸ§  Key Observations
//If the height m of all towers is 1, then no move is possible (because you can't reduce height 1 to anything smaller while maintaining a divisor).
//ðŸ”¸ Player 1 loses immediately â†’ Player 2 wins
//
//If m > 1 and the number of towers n is even, then:
//
//Player 2 can mirror every move Player 1 makes (since the number of towers is even),
//
//Which means Player 2 always wins if they play optimally.
//
//If m > 1 and the number of towers n is odd, Player 1 has a strategic advantage and can force a win.
